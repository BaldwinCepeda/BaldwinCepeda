# Hi, I'm Baldwin Cepeda 👋  
**Software Engineer | Web3 Security Engineer | Security Automation**

I build secure distributed systems, Ethereum infrastructure, MEV research pipelines, and large-scale automation across Microsoft and Web3 ecosystems.  

For the past 5+ years I’ve worked across **DeFi, blockchain security, MEV engineering, and enterprise security automation** for organizations including **Polygon, CUNY Research Foundation, and Avanade (Accenture + Microsoft)**.

My work spans:

- Ethereum node operations (execution + consensus clients, archival nodes, telemetry, recovery)
- MEV research (mempool analytics, Flashbots bundles, fork simulation)
- Secure smart-contract engineering (Solidity audits, fuzzing, invariants, Foundry)
- Enterprise security automation (PowerShell, Python, AD/Entra, CI/CD)
- Large-scale ETL, reliability engineering, and cloud-native systems

## 🔥 What I Do

### **Web3 Security Engineering**
- Smart-contract security: fuzzing, invariants, reentrancy, proxy upgrade design  
- MEV research: mempool monitoring, bundle simulation, arbitrage analysis  
- Ethereum core operations: client upgrades, archival pruning, monitoring, recovery  
- Governance participation in protocols such as **Origin Dollar (OUSD)**  

### **Security Automation & Systems Engineering**
- Automated multi-tenant Active Directory migrations & remediation (**65,000+ objects processed**)  
- PowerShell + Python pipelines for CI/CD, audit logging, compliance, and IR  
- Reliability engineering for enterprise Windows/Linux and cloud infrastructure  
- Data engineering for security staffing pipelines (bench reduced ~25%)

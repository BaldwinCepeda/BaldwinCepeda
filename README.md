**Software Engineer • Web3 Security Engineer**

I build secure distributed systems, Ethereum infrastructure, and MEV research tooling.  
My experience spans DeFi, blockchain security, MEV engineering, and enterprise-scale automation across Polygon, CUNY Research Foundation, and Avanade (Accenture + Microsoft).

**Focus Areas**
- Ethereum node operations (execution + consensus, archival, telemetry)
- MEV research: mempool analytics, Flashbots bundles, fork simulations
- Smart-contract security: fuzzing, invariants, reentrancy, upgrade patterns
- Security automation: PowerShell/Python pipelines, AD/Entra, CI/CD
- Large-scale data/infra engineering and reliability work

---

## Web3 Security Engineering
-  led workshops on audits and exploit patterns  
- Built MEV research bots for bundle simulation, latency benchmarking, and strategy analysis  
- Operated Ethereum archival nodes with full client lifecycle management (upgrades, pruning, monitoring)  
- Contributor to governance discussions (e.g., Origin Dollar)

---

## Security Automation & Systems Engineering
- Developed Python and JavaScript automation used for identity operations, security workflows, and telemetry.  
- Automated multi-tenant AD migrations and remediation workflows (**65,000+ directory objects processed**).  
- Built PowerShell, Python, and JS pipelines for incident response, compliance, and CI/CD integration.  
- Led reliability engineering across Windows/Linux and cloud environments to improve uptime and auditability.  
- Created data automation for staffing and capacity planning, reducing operational bench by **~25%**.
